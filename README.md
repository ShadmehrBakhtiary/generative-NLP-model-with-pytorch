# LSTM Text Generation Model: Peace and War

This repository contains code implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for generating text, based on the novel "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy. The model is trained on the text data from the novel to learn the patterns and structure of the writing, and then can be used to generate new text similar in style to the original piece.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you can use Google Colab for a convenient environment. The code provided includes functions for encoding text, creating training batches, implementing LSTM model architecture, training the model, and generating text predictions.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as PyTorch, NumPy, and matplotlib.

### Installing

You can run the code directly in a Google Colab notebook by mounting your Google Drive and importing the necessary libraries.

## Usage

1. Upload the text file containing "War and Peace" to your Google Drive in a specified folder.
2. Modify the file path in the code to point to the location of the text file.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to encode the text, create training batches, define the LSTM model, train the model, and generate text predictions.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model used in this code is implemented using PyTorch and consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by a linear layer for character prediction. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.

## Results

After training the model, you can use it to generate text by providing a seed phrase. The model will predict the next characters based on the seed and generate text of the specified length.



## Acknowledgments

This code is inspired by the book "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy and utilizes concepts from natural language processing and recurrent neural networks.

Feel free to customize and build upon this code for your text generation projects. Happy coding!
